# Tesla Landing Page Clone

Rebuilt Tesla's [(tesla.com)](https://www.tesla.com/) landing page with HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript

## Project Description

I built this Tesla landing page clone to test my development skills by taking a set design and replicating it to a high quality level. I built this with HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript.
  
A few areas of focus for this project include:   
- Responsive, mobile-first design using media queries  
- CSS animations using keyframes  
- Hamburger Side Menu with JavaScript  
- Deeper dive in positioning with Flexbox
